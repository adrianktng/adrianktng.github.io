We explore the aetiology of cybersickness by integrating sensory conflict and postural instability using VR display.

Abstract:
Sensory conflict theory and postural instability theory were often tested individually to explain cybersickness in VR systems, but they were seldom systematically compared. An earlier study evaluated them on a large screen using 2D videos. This study evaluated sensory conflict and postural instability on the discomfort in VR. Virtual visual locomotion were shown on an head-mounted display. A motion platform vibrated in low-frequency while the participant stood on top. Each factor was manipulated alone or in combination. Results showed that the visual motion only condition led to the highest miserable score, higher than the physical vibration only condition. This suggested that consistent with previous literature, sensory conflict may be a major contributing factor of cybersickness.
