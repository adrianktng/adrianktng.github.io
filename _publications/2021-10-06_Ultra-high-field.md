We use advanced 7T laminar brain imagining and AI to understand the key computations performed by the human brain during stereoscopic perception.

Abstract:
Binocular disparity provides critical information about three-dimensional (3D) structures to support perception and action. In the past decade significant progress has been made in uncovering human brain areas engaged in the processing of binocular disparity signals. Yet, the fine-scale brain processing underlying 3D perception remains unknown. Here, we use ultra-high-field (7T) functional imaging at submillimeter resolution to examine fine-scale BOLD fMRI signals involved in 3D perception. In particular, we sought to interrogate the local circuitry involved in disparity processing by sampling fMRI responses at different positions relative to the cortical surface (i.e., across cortical depths corresponding to layers). We tested for representations related to 3D perception by presenting participants (male and female, N = 8) with stimuli that enable stable stereoscopic perception [i.e., correlated random dot stereograms (RDS)] versus those that do not (i.e., anticorrelated RDS). Using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we demonstrate cortical depth-specific representations in areas V3A and V7 as indicated by stronger pattern responses for correlated than for anticorrelated stimuli in upper rather than deeper layers. Examining informational connectivity, we find higher feedforward layer-to-layer connectivity for correlated than anticorrelated stimuli between V3A and V7. Further, we observe disparity-specific feedback from V3A to V1 and from V7 to V3A. Our findings provide evidence for the role of V3A as a key nexus for disparity processing, which is implicated in feedforward and feedback signals related to the perceptual estimation of 3D structures.

Significance Statement:
Binocular vision plays a significant role in supporting our interactions with the surrounding environment. The fine-scale neural mechanisms that underlie the brain's skill in extracting 3D structures from binocular signals are poorly understood. Here, we capitalize on recent advances in ultra-high-field functional imaging to interrogate human brain circuits involved in 3D perception at submillimeter resolution. We provide evidence for the role of area V3A as a key nexus for disparity processing, which is implicated in feedforward and feedback signals related to the perceptual estimation of 3D structures from binocular signals. These fine-scale measurements help bridge the gap between animal neurophysiology and human fMRI studies investigating cross-scale circuits, from micro circuits to global brain networks for 3D perception.
