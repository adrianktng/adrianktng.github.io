We use VR display to understand the inference on self-esteem and cognitive ability during height perception alternation.

Abstract:
Tall stature has long been regarded as a socially desirable asset. Past literature has uncovered a positive correlation between height and cognitive ability, with evidence indicating that subjective evaluations of self-worth are highly susceptible to changes in body image. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether implementing a deliberate increase in height perception can affect individuals’ state self-esteem, working memory, and visuospatial competency. Adapting the theoretical model of height-career success relationship, it is hypothesized that height alteration would lead to higher levels of positive self-appraisals, as well as better objective and subjective cognitive performance. In this pilot study, we leveraged an immersive virtual reality system to manipulate individuals’ height. Participants conducted a series of letter recall and mental rotation tests, estimated their cognitive performance, and completed the State Self-Esteem Scale in a virtual environment. While improvements in working memory and spatial skills were observed in the increased height condition, ratings of self-perceived performance did not significantly differ. Among all facets of self-esteem, only appearance self-esteem showed a significant increase under the influence of height enhancement. This may suggest that benefits of taller height perceptions are sensitive to stature-related self-evaluations, even in the absence of external appraisals.
