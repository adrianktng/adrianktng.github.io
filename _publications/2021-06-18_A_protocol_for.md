We describe a protocol used in our ultra-high field imaging to measure and analyze activity in the human brain.

Abstract:
Ultra-high field (UHF) neuroimaging affords the sub-millimeter resolution that allows researchers to interrogate brain computations at a finer scale than that afforded by standard fMRI techniques. Here, we present a step-by-step protocol for using UHF imaging (Siemens Terra 7T scanner) to measure activity in the human brain. We outline how to preprocess the data using a pipeline that combines tools from SPM, FreeSurfer, ITK-SNAP, and BrainVoyager and correct for vasculature-related confounders to improve the spatial accuracy of the fMRI signal.

For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Jia et al. (2020) and Zamboni et al. (2020).
